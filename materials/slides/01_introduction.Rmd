# Background


## 'Data Science'?

*"This coupling of scientific discovery and practice involves the collection, management, processing, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of vast amounts of heterogeneous data associated with a diverse array of scientific, translational, and inter-disciplinary applications."*

University of Michigan 'Data Science Initiative', 2015


## But, what about statistics?!

*"Seemingly, statistics is being marginalized here; the implicit message is that statistics is a part of what goes on in data science but not a very big part. At the same time, many of the concrete descriptions of what the DSI will actually do will seem to statisticians to be bread-and-butter statistics. Statistics is apparently the word that dare not speak its name in connection with such an initiative!"*

David Donoho (2015). __50 years of Data Science__

## What's new about all this?

*"All in all, I have come to feel that my central interest is in data analysis, which I take to include, among other things: procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data."*

## Technological change

## Relevance for modern economic research

```{r css, echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig.align='center',  purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../../img/css.png")
```


## Relevance for modern economic research

```{r internet, echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig.align='center',  purl=FALSE}

## Data science in economics skill set

## Data science as a life skill

```


## Data science as a life skill

"More than anything, what data scientists do is *make discoveries while swimming in data.* ...  As they make discoveries, they communicate what they’ve learned and suggest its implications for new business directions. Often they are *creative in displaying information visually and making the patterns they find clear and compelling*... 

They advise executives and product managers on the implications of the data for *products, processes, and decisions*.

What kind of person does all this? *Think of him or her as a hybrid of data hacker, analyst, communicator, and trusted adviser. The combination is extremely powerful — and rare.*"
